        <h1>How useful <br>IS OOP?</h1>
        <p>OOP has helped me signifinicantly in my website. It encourages reusability of codes which can make our CSS shorter and more concise.<br>
            <br>I enjoyed studing it because it was like simply organizing things, and in our case organizing codes which can ot only improve readability but also help the programmer so some elements can be efficiently use in the whoel program. <br>

<!------------------- oop second ANS ------------------>
    <section class="answer1">
        <p>OOCSS would now be the CSS that I would practice as I learned how convenient it could be if it was used correctly, Unfortunatel, it was too late for me to apply all the things that I learned about OOCSS and I wasn't able to apply in on my whole program because I enjoyed designing my webpage too much. I honestly don't know much about HTML AND CSS and it was my first time making this whole new progam so I wanted it to look and work great, but I guess it is not something that can be done with just weeks because it got really difficult when I had to search the elements one by one. But in the end, I'm confident and I'm glad about our project, because I learned a lot. Like a lot since I don't know much about OOCSS. </p>
